# iOS 26

i watched a [2 hour video][ios26-features-youtube] so you wouldn't have to

[ios26-features-youtube]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JJKwjHUWRE

## general / important

- obviously the big new redesign is "Liquid Glass". you can see this in many
  places online in case you want to check it out, but basically everything has
  this "glassy" look now. apple has gone all-in on this with glassy toggles,
  glassy buttons, glassy menu bars, glassy transitions, etc. it's a big thing.
  - you can get rid of the glassy look somewhat by enabling "Reduce
    Transparency" under Accessibility > Display & Text Size, but it won't fix
    all the issues with it. i still hate it.
- home bar will no longer be always present; it will disappear if able to
  provide a more seamless and clean look
- full-screen screenshot preview (when taking a screenshot)
  - magnifier tool in markup
  - visual intelligence (circle something to look it up)
  - ask chatgpt about the screenshot
  - new section in settings called "Screen Capture" for more
- new Preview app
  - useful for viewing / editing pdfs
- custom snooze duration for alarms (1-15 minutes)

## accessibility

- share settings with others
- hover text
- "accessibility nutrition labels": apps now show any accessibility features
  they have in the app store
- customize appearance of vehicle motion cues

## airpods

- charging notifications (even if airpods are not connected)
- pause media if airpods detect that you're asleep
- airpods gestures can control the camera ("Camera Remote" setting)
- live translation for airpods pro 2, airpods 3, and airpods 4

## apple intelligence

i'm personally against the complete and total takeover of AI within ios (and
everything else), but i documented this anyway. you're welcome.

- genmoji: can create mixmoji by combining multiple emojis or memojis of your
  contacts
- image playground: can choose between different styles for the generated images
  (used to only have "sketch", but there is now "animation", "illustration",
  "genmoji", and "chatgpt" [use chatgpt to generate an image, and you can also
  select a different style for chatgpt to use])

## battery

- low battery has a new dynamic island animation where you can enable low power
  mode
- in settings:
  - last time charged
  - if charging, time until charged (also shows up on lockscreen)
    - this will say "Slow Charger" if the time can't be determined
  - better usage insights ("you're using more battery today than usual")
  - usage information per app
  - set charge limit (80% - 100%)
  - "Adaptive Power Mode" (on by default): automatically make performance
    adjustments to extend battery life when usage is higher than normal

## camera

- big general redesign. just look it up
- can change image/video format and resolution from camera menus directly
  (instead of going through settings)
- other camera controls are available through a menu button in the top right
  (used to be shown by swiping up)
- setting for "Lens Cleaning Hints"

  and Dual Capture (always accessible through the top right menu, but these are

  some game mode settings and game center shortcuts

## facetime

- updated home view in app (grid of recent calls instead of list)
- self camera is now in the bottom left and live photo button is now in the top
  right (used to be swapped)
- call controls are on the right side (used to be along the top)
- when tapping on your own camera view, the controls are along the bottom (used
  to be around the corners of your view)
  - you also need to tap on the "minimize" button to get out of this view now.
    you used to be able to tap outside of it, so this feels harder to do, which
    is a step backward smh

## health / fitness

- new sleep score (yay gamification)

- clock color between "glass" (slightly transparent) and "solid"
- widgets can be at the bottom
- wallpaper photo can be made a "spatial scene" where the subject of the photo
  will appear to "pop out" so when you rotate your phone around you will see a
  parallax effect. this only works with photos where there is a clear subject.
- always on display has new option to blur wallpaper photo
- redesigned timer / alarm done screen
- some albums will show animated artwork (might only be an apple music thing?)

## messages

- messages from an unknown sender can be marked as "known"

  "Delete and Stop", which will automatically reply the necessary text to stop

- apple cash in group chats

- more visibility of blocked contacts (notification in group chats, "blocked"
  icon next to their name in conversation list)

## music

- AutoMix: smooth transition between songs at the "right time" (based on key and
  tempo) (Crossfade is just a simple transition)

  button on the right)

  ask the caller why they're calling and show you a live transcript so you can
  choose if you want to pick up

  on hold, then bring it back when it detects you're no longer on hold
- swipe left on a recent call to set a reminder to call them back
